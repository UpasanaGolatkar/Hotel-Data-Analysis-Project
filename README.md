Hotel Data Analysis Project
In this project, I performed an analysis of hotel data with the goal of uncovering key insights into booking trends, customer preferences, and operational performance. The project involved:

Database Creation: Built and structured a database from raw hotel data to ensure efficient data management.

SQL Query Development: Wrote complex SQL queries to extract, filter, and analyze specific data sets from the database.

Power BI Integration: Connected Power BI to the database for real-time data visualization.

Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards to visualize trends and performance metrics.

Summary of Findings: Generated actionable insights to help inform decision-making related to marketing strategies and customer service improvements.

This project demonstrates my ability to manage end-to-end data analysis processes, from database construction to insightful reporting using SQL and Power BI.
